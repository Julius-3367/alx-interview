Lockboxes Problem - README.md

This document explains how to solve the "Lockboxes" problem, where you have a set of locked boxes and keys, and you need to determine if all boxes can be eventually opened.

Understanding the Problem:

You are presented with a list of lists, where each inner list represents the keys found within a specific locked box.
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n-1 (where n is the total number of boxes).
A key with the same number as a box (i) can open that particular box (i).
All keys are assumed to be positive integers.
Some boxes might not have any keys.
The very first box (boxes[0]) is guaranteed to be unlocked.
Goal:

The objective is to determine if, using the keys found within the boxes, it's possible to eventually open all the boxes.

Solution Approach:

The solution utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore the connected components within a graph that represents the key dependencies. Here's a breakdown of the general steps:

Data Structure:

Maintain a set to track boxes that have been visited during the exploration.
Initialization:

Mark the first box (boxes[0]) as visited.
Create a queue to store boxes that need to be explored further.
Add the first box (boxes[0]) to the queue.
BFS Exploration:

While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a box (current_box) from the queue.
Iterate through all keys (key) found in boxes[current_box]:
If the key (key) hasn't been visited yet:
Mark the corresponding box (key) as visited.
Add the box (key) to the queue for further exploration.
Result:

After processing all boxes in the queue, if the size of the visited set matches the total number of boxes (n), it signifies that all boxes can be eventually opened. Otherwise, there are unreachable boxes, and not all boxes can be opened.
Key Points:

The BFS algorithm systematically explores the connections between boxes through their keys.
If all boxes become eventually visited, it implies that all boxes can be opened by following the key dependencies.
Benefits of BFS:

BFS effectively identifies connected components within a graph, which is crucial in this problem.
It ensures that all reachable boxes are explored before moving on to potentially disconnected ones.
Conclusion:

By employing a Breadth-First Search approach, you can efficiently determine if all boxes are reachable and therefore openable in the lockbox scenario. This solution provides a clear and concise overview without including explicit code.
